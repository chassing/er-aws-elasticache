    AWS rejects SET unless a token was already ROTATEd in, but ROTATE alone

    ROTATE, then SET. describe_replication_groups can't distinguish "optional
    token from ROTATE" from "required token from SET" once settled, so progress
    is tracked via a dedicated terraform_data marker instead of AWS's own API.
    Ref: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/auth.html

    AWS also rejects any AUTH token operation while transit_encryption_mode is
    "preferred" (confirmed live) - "The AUTH token modification is only
    supported when encryption-in-transit is enabled" - so this is gated on the
    replication group's prior transit_encryption_mode too. A missing/unknown
